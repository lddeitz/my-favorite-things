First performed on 14 February 1895 at the St James's Theatre in London, The Importance of Being Earnest is a farcical comedy in which the protagonists maintain fictitious personae to escape burdensome social obligations. 

Working within the social conventions of late Victorian London, the play's major themes are the triviality with which it treats institutions as serious as marriage, and the resulting satire of Victorian ways. Some contemporary reviews praised the play's humour and the culmination of Wilde's artistic career, while others were cautious about its lack of social messages.
