It's hard where you're living
Adding weight to make it balanced
Saying it could be too much
But he's clasping to his tie

There was a finer life
When I was with my friends and I could always see my family
That's what I still want now
Even if I'm here and I know they won't be waiting
Cause I don't want to be alone
I don't want to be here alone
While you're there give back a little more
The return could make you notice
That I'm thinking of a moment
And know its still sound
