Come on out
Since when did you
Stop leaving your house

You don't seem sure
What you want to happen now
Are you having fun
(Am I having fun)
Can you have some fun
(I want to go home now)
You'll see me when I go back
I know it won't be hard

Can't tell you how I know
This is where I want you to
Take me when I die and I'm full of sleep
Underneath the pine on a bed of leaves
Sorry if I pass you by
I never saw into your eyes
I was only thinking of my home
And how it's so far

Get away
Since you don't know
How to be yourself
You don't seem sure
What you want to happen now
Can you leave us now
(I'm gonna leave you now)
(Alright I'll go)
