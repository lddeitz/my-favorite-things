It's at certain times of nowhere
(Mhm)
In some time, you will understand
Seen those eyes, talking to myself
(Mhm)
You will never end
You never end

[Verse: Yung Lean]
Tell you how it goes back
I want to show you that
Wish I just could go back
When we would sleep in grass
Wish you never met me
I can't sleep at night
Remember you last summer
I thought it would never end
You will never end
You will never end
You never end

[Chorus: Yung Lean, Ariel Pink & Both]
Glimmering shadows, night
I walk with the stars, with the stars, yeah
She walks on solid ground
But tonight, with the stars, in the stars, yeah
She walks by, she walks by
But she dances with the stars, with the stars, yeah
Sometimes I have no insight
You think you know who you are, who you are, yeah
Glimmering shadows, night
I walk with the stars, with the stars, yeah
She walks on solid ground
But tonight, with the stars, with the stars, yeah
She walks by, she walks by
But she dances with the stars
Sometimes I have no insight
You think you know, think you know who you are, who you are, yeah
You think you know who you are, who you are, yeah
I walk with the stars, with the stars, yeah
I walk with the stars, with the stars, yeah
I walk with the stars, with the stars, yeah

[Outro: Yung Lean]
You will never end
You will never end
You never end
