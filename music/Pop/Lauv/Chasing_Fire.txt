I wanna hate you 'cause I still love you
And it's weighing on my chest
We keep our bodies tied together
To ignore what's coming next

I was driving you home in the middle of the night
But I couldn't bring myself to say goodbye
I was driving you home in the middle of the night
And there's no good way, yeah there's no good way

I'm chasing fire when I'm running after you
You got that something that I never wanna lose, lose, yeah
It's like dancing when the song's already over
Moving without getting any closer, oh oh oh oh
I'm chasing fire when I'm running after you
