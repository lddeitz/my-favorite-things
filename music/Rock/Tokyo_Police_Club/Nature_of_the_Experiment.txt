We've got our tracks covered
Thanks to your older brother
It's not the moonlight that sets me off
It's not the money that makes me scoff
It's my impeccable disorder
Where I keep on falling for her
It's not the way my mother talks
It's not the people that she mocks
It's the nature of the experiment
It's the patterns of my temperament
It's the nature of the experiment
They're taking me in increments
We're halfway up the bracket
The rain comes through my jacket
It's not the stones inside my shoes
It's not the risk of what's to lose
It's an ancient Russian proverb
I doubt it's ones that you've heard
It's not the cracks beneath the floor
It's not the fact that it's a chore
It's the nature of the experiment
It's the patterns of my temperament
It's the nature of the experiment
Taking me in increments
