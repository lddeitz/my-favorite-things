My hands shake
And they long to be held in the cold
'Cause the winters are hell when it snows
'Til the bodies are covered
60 years of crime in my family
Like my father and his before me
Black cars and laundromats

But they threw their hearts
Into the sea
Now they will beat forever
With the bodies of their enemies
'Cause they threw their hearts
Into the sea
Now they will beat forever
With the bodies of their enemies

I've been told
That the world's greatest heist will unfold
When the clock strikes 12 and it tolls
This time don't stand a chance
In my room
And the father is at the door
His heir and the next crime lord
My hands long to be held
